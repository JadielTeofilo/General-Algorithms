"""
Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.

Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.

Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

NOTE:

    You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).


 A = [60, 100, 120]
 B = [10, 20, 30]
 C = 50

use a cache on start, capacity
we stop when capacity is zero or start is at the end of the list
iterate from start to len of values
    if capcity minus weight is smaller then zero we continue
