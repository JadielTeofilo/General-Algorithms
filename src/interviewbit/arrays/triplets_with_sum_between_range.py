"""

Given an array of real numbers greater than zero in form of strings.

Find if there exists a triplet (a,b,c) such that 1 < a+b+c < 2 . 

Return 1 for true or 0 for false.


0.6 0.7 0.8 1.2 0.4
0.6 1.3 2.1 3.3 3.7 


brute force would be to just try all n^3 possibilities

the order does not matter
sorting is an option
