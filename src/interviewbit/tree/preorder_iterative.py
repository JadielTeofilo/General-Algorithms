"""
Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodesâ€™ values.

Example :

Given binary tree

   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

return [1,2,3].

Using recursion is not allowed.


while stack
    peek from the stack
    if not  visited 
        add to result
        add to visited
    if left and not in visited add to stack
    same for right
    else
        pop from stack - meaning there is no left or right left to be used
