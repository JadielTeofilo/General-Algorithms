"""
Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

College library has N bags,the ith book has A[i] number of pages.

You have to allocate books to B number of students so that maximum number of pages alloted to a student is minimum.

A book will be allocated to exactly one student.
Each student has to be allocated at least one book.
Allotment should be in contiguous order, for example: A student cannot be allocated book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2.

Calculate and return that minimum possible number.

NOTE: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible.


In - nums: List[int], bags: int
Out - min_sum: int

3
2 3 5 1 2 8 8

It is basically about finding partitions that minimize the max on any given bag 

one way to do it is to generate all possible partitions
				
						2 3 5 1 2 8 8 (2)
	2|3 5 1 2 8 8, (1)

basically building all possible contÃ­guous blocks 

solve(nums: List[int], runnig_sum: List[int], partitions: int, start: int)

memoize the start and get a O(n^2) time complexity

Other option is:

start with the max bag sum of sum(nums) and try building the bags

2
3 2 2 8 3  sum = 18

start = 1, end = max_bag
pivot = (start + end) // 2
iterate on nums until the sum gets to pivot
	decrease one from partition, reset the sum and continue 
at the end, if partition > 0 
	start = pivot + 1
else:
	end = pivot - 1
