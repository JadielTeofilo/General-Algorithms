"""
Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integars C of size N.

Element C[i] represents length of ith board.

You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of board.

Calculate and return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

        2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
        cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
        A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
        configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
        invalid.

Return the ans % 10000003

start = max(nums)
end = sum(nums)

check if partition is valid = number of partitions < painters
    if not, try with a bigger time
else,  try with a smaller time
